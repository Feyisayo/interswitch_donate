Interswitch Donate allows users to make donations using their InterSwitch bank cards.

It is my attempt to get familiar with Drupal 8, the latest iteration of the very impressive CMF.

HOW WILL IT WORK?
1) On the back-end, an administrator sets up donations purposes. These are the various things users can donate to.
2) The administrator also sets up the integration credentials from Interswitch.
2) On the front-end, a user views on the donation form, selects a donation purpose, sets the donation amount and proceeds.
3) Upon confirmation, the user is redirected to Interswitch.
4) On return, if the payment is successful the user gets an success notice as well as an email notification
5) If the payment is not successful the user gets an failure notice

ISSUES
* ISW logo on form not showing
* Session data not removed on form submit or validate
